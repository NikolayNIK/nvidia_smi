A third-party Dart library interfacing with `nvidia-smi` utility.

**The project is not affiliated with the NVIDIA Corporation in any way and is not endorsed by it.** It is merely a convinient binding for interfacing with `nvidia-smi` to get NVIDIA GPU properties, running processes, etc.

To query the driver make sure `nvidia-smi` executable is available in the environment and the process has the right permissions to execute it.
